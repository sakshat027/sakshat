<h1> Staw Hats </h1>
<p> The Straw Hat Pirates, also known as the Mugiwara Pirates, Straw Hat Crew or simply the Straw Hats, are a very infamous and powerful pirate crew that originated from the East Blue.

The "Straw Hats" are named after Luffy's signature hat that was given to him by "Red-Haired" Shanks and are first referred to as the Straw Hat Pirates by Smoker in the Arabasta Kingdom. The crew sailed on the Going Merry, their first official Straw Hat ship, up until the Water 7 Arc. During the Post-Enies Lobby Arc, Franky and Iceburg built them a new ship which was named the Thousand Sunny by Iceburg, even though the members fought over different names.

Following the events on the Sabaody Archipelago, all the members were separated from one another by Bartholomew Kuma, a then-Warlord of the Sea and undercover agent of the Revolutionary Army. For two years, they trained in relatively isolated locations, becoming stronger for the sake of helping each other. They then reunited and have since continued to be a dynamic force in the New World, greatly disrupting the balance of the Three Great Powers. After the Raid on Onigashima, with the defeats of Kaidou and Big Mom, their captain officially became one of the new Four Emperors.

They are the main focus and protagonists of the manga and anime One Piece and are led by the main protagonist Monkey D. Luffy.</p>

  <h2> Monkey D Luffy</h2>

  <p> Monkey D. Luffy (/ˈluːfi/ LOO-fee) (Japanese: モンキー・D・ルフィ, Hepburn: Monkī Dī Rufi, [ɾɯɸiː]), also known as "Straw Hat" Luffy[n 2], is a fictional character and the protagonist in the Japanese manga series One Piece created by Eiichiro Oda. Luffy made his debut as a young boy who acquires the properties of rubber after accidentally eating one of the Devil Fruits that belonged to "Red Hair" Shanks.

  Monkey D. Luffy is the captain of the Straw Hat Pirates, and dreamt of being a pirate since childhood from the influence of his idol and mentor Red-Haired Shanks. At the age of 17, Luffy sets sail from the East Blue Sea to the Grand Line in search of the legendary treasure, One Piece, to succeed Gol D. Roger as "King of the Pirates".

  He fights multiple antagonists, and aids and befriends the inhabitants of several islands on his journey. Usually cheerful, he becomes serious and even aggressive when he fights. Luffy uses his rubber body to concentrate his power, executing a range of attacks. In his signature attack, the Gum-Gum Pistol, he slingshots punches at opponents from a distance. Luffy also grows stronger over the course of the story by transforming his body through different "Gears;" this is reflected in his bounty, which is used to measure the threat he poses to the World Government. He is the grandson of Monkey D. Garp, who is a vice-admiral of the Navy; the son of Monkey D. Dragon, who is the leader of the Revolutionary Army;[10] and sworn brother of Portgas D. Ace and Sabo.[11]

  Luffy appears in most of the episodes, films, television specials, and OVAs of the manga's anime adaptations and several of the franchise's video games. He is the only character in One Piece who appears in every story arc of the series. Due to the series' international popularity, Luffy is one of the world's most recognizable manga and anime characters. In addition to the One Piece franchise, the character appears in a number of manga and anime series and collaborative video games. His critical reception is largely positive.</p>

  <h2> Roronoa Zoro</h2>
  <p> oronoa Zoro first appears in the manga chapter "Enter Pirate Hunter Zoro" ("海賊狩りのゾロ"登場, Kaizoku-gari no Zoro Tōjō), first published in Japan's Weekly Shōnen Jump magazine on August 18, 1997, and first appeared in 1st Episode of anime.[9] He first appears as a captured criminal awaiting his execution at the hands of the Marines.[9] Before the beginning of the series' narrative, Zoro loses his childhood friend Kuina and vows to become the strongest swordsman in the world.[10] For years, Zoro hunts pirates as a bounty hunter only to get money for food in the company of his friends Johnny and Yosaku. Zoro initially did this because he got lost seeking to face the best swordsman in the world, Dracule Mihawk. When Luffy offers Zoro the opportunity to join his crew, Zoro initially refuses. But after Luffy saves him from execution, Zoro pledges loyalty to him. Zoro is later easily defeated at Mihawk's hands at the Baratie restaurant and pledges to Luffy that he would never lose again.

  Zoro's loyalty to Luffy is incomparable among the crew and develops through the series. Even though he joined Luffy's crew, his main goal was to become the strongest swordsman. Originally Zoro threatened to kill Luffy if he ever got in the way of this goal. He listens to his captain's order and follows the order until the very end. On Jaya, Zoro followed Luffy's orders not to fight an enemy in a bar no matter what and followed it without hesitation. In "Water 7," Zoro upholds the authority of Luffy as captain during Luffy's fight with Usopp and Usopp's leaving of the crew. Zoro pointedly refuses to allow Usopp to rejoin the crew without an apology and threatens to be the next to leave because to let Usopp "back as if nothing happened was an insult to Luffy's authority as captain. He even slapped Luffy with the reality that being a pirate isn't a game.

  On the next island, Thriller Bark, Bartholomew Kuma confronted a knocked-out Luffy and the Straw Hats and asked the protagonists to surrender Luffy. Everyone refused, and Kuma knocked everyone out except for Zoro, Sanji, and Brook. Zoro offers to sacrifice his life for Luffy, proclaiming that Luffy will be the man to become Pirate King. Sanji also offers his life, but Zoro knocks out Sanji to save his life. Zoro begs Kuma not to take Luffy and to take him instead. Zoro told Kuma that he is even willing to give up his dream of becomthe world's greatest swordsman for Luffy's dream. After seeing this, Kuma agreed to Zoro instead of taking Zoro with him. Kuma asked to take all Luffy's pain after fighting Gecko Moria. Zoro's dream in the entire series was to become the world's greatest swordsman, but he is willing to give that up for Luffy, showing how loyal Zoro grew to his captain after initially threatening to end Luffy's life for threatening his dream.

  After fighting Daz Bonez in Alabasta, Zoro's bounty is initially set at 60,000,000 but is later raised to 120,000,000 after fighting the World Government at Enies Lobby. Later, the crew is separated by Bartholomew Kuma, which resulted in pre and post-time skips. Zoro encounters Mihawk again and trains under him for two years before reuniting with the crew. He receives a bounty of 320,000,000 after cutting up an antagonist as large as a mountain and assisting Luffy at the end of Don Quixote Doflamingo's tyrannical rule. After the events in Wano Country and his contributions in the Onigashima Raid such as defeating King, he receives a bounty of 1,111,000,000.

  In One Piece volume 105, Oda revealed Zoro's family history. His father, Roronoa Arashi, was killed by pirates and his mother, Tera, died of illness when he was young. Zoro is a descendant of the Shimotsuki family of Wano Country through his grandmother Furiko, the older sister of Ushimaru, the daimyo of Ringo who is Zoro's great-uncle. Zoro is related to Kuina as distant cousins and is the descendant of Shimotsuki Ryuma.</p>

  <h2> Vinesmoke Sanji</h2>
  <p>Born as a prince of Germa Kingdom, a floating kingdom composed of several ships on the shells of large snails, Vinsmoke Sanji (ヴィンスモーク・サンジ, Vinsumōku Sanji) is routinely ridiculed by his genetically enhanced sociopathic siblings and is locked away by his father Judge for being a disgrace. His appeals for help are met with disdain from Judge.[14] With help from his sister Reiju, he escapes and flees Germa. On his way out, Sanji encounters his father, who tells him that if he is to run away, he must never tell anyone of his relation to the Germa, feeling shameful about their connection. Sanji eventually flees on a cruise ship known as the Orbit.

  While serving as an apprentice cook on a passenger ship, nine-year-old Sanji stands up to a boarding party of pirates led by the infamous "Red Foot" Zeff. During the encounter, Sanji is swept into the sea by a massive wave. Zeff jumps in after him because of their common dream of finding the All Blue (オールブルー, Ōru Burū), a legendary area where the East, West, North, and South Blue seas meet, containing every kind of fish in the world. While castaways together, the pirate saves Sanji's life yet again by giving him all of their food. After their eventual rescue, Sanji stays with Zeff for several years and helps him build a floating restaurant, the Baratie (バラティエ). Zeff in turn makes him a first-rate cook and teaches him his kick-based fighting style.[ch. 56–59] Mirroring Zeff, Sanji will never refuse a starving person a meal, and he uses only his legs when fighting to protect the hands he needs for cooking.[ch. 48, 370] He has a weakness for women and makes it a principle never to harm one, even if it means his death.

  Eventually Sanji becomes infamous as "Black Leg" Sanji (黒脚のサンジ, Kuro Ashi no Sanji).[ch. 435] In Thriller Bark, he offers to give up his life in exchange for Luffy's.[17] While training for a period of two years in Emporio Ivankov's Kamabakka Queendom (カマバッカ王国, Kamabakka Ōkoku), he develops the Sky Walk (空中歩行スカイ・ウォーク, Sukai Wōku), a variant of the Six Powers (六式, Rokushiki) technique Moonwalk (月歩, Geppo), which allows him to essentially run through air.[ch. 635] In Zou, Sanji is forced into an arranged marriage with the daughter of Big Mom, one of the Four Emperors. Sanji decides to leave the crew in order to confront his family and protect the Straw Hats from the Big Mom Pirates.[18] However Luffy invades the Big Mom Pirates' Empire to save Sanji, but Sanji is unwilling to let his family, though he despises them, die in a trap laid out by Big Mom, who seeks their powerful technology. Luffy responds by acknowledging that such kindness is the heart of Sanji's character. Together they manage to save Sanji's family and escape Big Mom, earning bounty increases. Sanji is pleased that his bounty exceed's Zoro's, but angered at the inclusion of his surname in the poster.[1] Sanji is also displeased to receive his own technologically enhanced Raid Suit from his family which grants him the ability to turn invisible.

  In Wano, Sanji asks for help from another for the first time when he asks Robin to save him from a woman enemy he is unwilling to fight. This is the first time Sanji asks for help in the present-day series from someone else.[14][15] Later he realizes using the Raid Suit began to awaken dormant genetic enhancements that his mother suppressed years ago. He had gained an exoskeleton, a superhuman physical constitution, accelerated healing, increase in strength and speed which enhanced his fighting style immensely and his skin has become bulletproof. Sadly, this had dampened his emotions as well when he realized he had hurt a woman unknowingly who unintentionally got his way and became extremely afraid of him but that was not the case, as it is confirmed by Sanji, that Queen used his invisibility to make it look like he did the beating. Fearing he is losing his heart and humanity, he destroys the Raid Suit canister, freeing himself from Germa's influence for good and stopping him from losing more of himself.</p>

  <h2> Jinbe</h2>
  <p>"Knight of the Sea" Jinbe is the helmsman of the Straw Hat Pirates and one of the Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet. He is the tenth member of the crew and the ninth to join, doing so during the Wano Country Arc.

  Jinbe is a whale shark fish-man and a powerful master of Fish-Man Karate. His dream is to fulfill his former captain Fisher Tiger's dying wish of coexistence and equality between humans and fish-men. He was a member of the Sun Pirates, eventually becoming its second captain after the death of their original captain, Tiger. He eventually became one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea, though he resigned during the Summit War of Marineford. Vegapunk later cloned Jinbe as one of the Seraphim, S-Shark, to replace the Warlords.

  Prior to and amidst said war, Jinbe befriended Monkey D. Luffy, and two years later allied with him and his crew to prevent the New Fish-Man Pirates' coup d'état against the Ryugu Kingdom's Neptune Royal Family. Luffy thereafter invited him to join the Straw Hat Pirates, but Jinbe held it off until severing ties with Big Mom during the Whole Cake Island Arc. After staying behind in Totto Land to protect the Sun Pirates from Big Mom's wrath, Jinbe returned to the Straw Hats during the Wano Country Arc, officially announcing his status as a member of the crew.[

  He first gained a bounty of Beli76,000,000 due to him being a member of the Sun Pirates. It was later increased to Beli250,000,000 after Jinbe became the new captain of the Sun Pirates before it was frozen after he joined the Seven Warlords. Upon resigning his position as a Warlord at the Summit War of Marineford, his bounty was reinstated at Beli438,000,000.Following the Raid on Onigashima, his bounty was increased to Beli1,100,000,000.</p>

<p> "Iron Man" Franky is the shipwright of the Straw Hat Pirates and one of the Senior Officers of the Straw Hat Grand Fleet. He is the crew's eighth member and the seventh to join, doing so at the end of the Post-Enies Lobby Arc.

Born "Cutty Flam", he chose to go by his nickname of "Franky" until eventually permanently discarding his true name per the request of Iceburg to hide his identity. Originally from the South Blue, Franky was abandoned by his family as a four-year-old, eventually making his way to Water 7. There, he came to be a member of Tom's Workers, until an incident resulted in his body being heavily damaged and requiring him to augment himself into a cyborg. Upon returning to Water 7, he became the leader of the Franky Family, a group of ship dismantlers and bounty hunters.

Franky and his followers were originally enemies of the Straw Hats at the beginning of the Water 7 Arc, until circumstances forced them to become allies at the end of the same arc and the Enies Lobby Arc. Franky's dream is to create a ship and circumnavigate the world with it, and he built the Thousand Sunny and joined the Straw Hat Pirates to fulfill his dream.

He gained a bounty of Beli44,000,000 for his involvement at the Enies Lobby Incident. It later increased to Beli94,000,000 after the Dressrosa Arc. Following the Raid on Onigashima, his bounty was increased to Beli394,000,000.</p>

She is the seventh member of the crew and the sixth to join, doing so at the end of the Arabasta Arc. She temporarily left the crew during the Water 7 Arc but rejoined during the Enies Lobby Arc.

  Born into a family of archaeologists, Robin is the daughter of Nico Olvia and an unknown man. Robin ate the Hana Hana no Mi at a young age, giving her the power to reproduce her body parts (or her entire body) on any surface at will. As the sole survivor of the destroyed West Blue island Ohara, she is currently one of only two people in the world known to have the ability to read and decipher Poneglyphs, a skill which is considered forbidden and threatening to the World Government.

  She acted as the vice president of Baroque Works as "Miss All Sunday", serving and partnering herself directly with the organization's president; the ex-Warlord: Crocodile, who operated under the codename "Mr. 0". She was a secondary antagonist of the Arabasta Saga, before joining the Straw Hats. Her dream is to find the Rio Poneglyph which tells the true history of the world, specifically the Void Century.

  She gained a bounty of Beli79,000,000 at the age of 8 due to her ability to read poneglyphs after the destruction of Ohara. It later increased to Beli80,000,000 after the Straw Hats invaded Enies Lobby to rescue her and escape. After the Dressrosa Arc, it was increased to Beli130,000,000. Following the Raid on Onigashima, her bounty was increased to Beli930,000,000.[</p>

  <h2> Tony Tony Chopper </h2>
  <p>Tony Tony Chopper (トニートニー・チョッパー, Tonī Tonī Choppā), otherwise known as "Cotton Candy Lover", is a fictional character in the manga series One Piece created by Eiichiro Oda. He is the sixth member to join and the doctor of the Straw Hat Pirates. Chopper is frequently featured on official merchandise, serving as a mascot for the series.

  The power of the Zoan-type Human-Human Fruit (ヒトヒト の実, Hito Hito no Mi) provides him with the ability to transform into a full-sized reindeer or a reindeer-human hybrid.[ch. 140] A drug he calls "Rumble Ball" (ランブル・ボール, Ranburu Bōru) enables him to perform even more transformations for a short time.

  Rejected by his herd because of his blue nose and eating the Devil Fruit, Chopper is rescued by Drum Island's quack doctor Doctor Hiriluk. While developing a potion to create cherry blossoms when in contact with snow, Chopper is heartbroken when Hiriluk falls ill with a deadly disease. After Hiriluk's death, Doctor Kureha takes him in as his mentor. After the Straw Hats arrive at Drum Island and take Chopper with them, Kureha uses Hiriluk's potion to turn the snowy sky into cherry blossoms, fulfilling Hiriluk's life mission. When complimented, Chopper acts flustered and sometimes yells at the person who complimented him to stop trying to make him happy. A running gag within the series is when other characters mistake him as a Tanuki, and he angrily corrects them, pointing out that he is a Tonakai (Japanese for "Reindeer").

  Brook ate the Yomi Yomi no Mi, which allowed him to return to life after death once. Brook eventually learned to tap deeper into the powers of his Devil Fruit, giving him significant control over his own soul and the souls of others.

  Originally a member of the Rumbar Pirates, he died and was resurrected through the power of the Yomi Yomi no Mi. However, due to the amount of time it took for his soul to find his body, it was reduced to a skeleton, keeping only his afro intact.[17] Brook drifted alone in the Florian Triangle for 50 years, eventually meeting Luffy and serving as the Straw Hats' ally during the Thriller Bark Arc before officially joining the crew.

  <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/73/bb/c2/73bbc2a6faf0fd13ecb4912ee2d70772.jpg">
  <h2> Usopp</h2>
  <p>Usopp lived on an island of the East Blue, in the Syrup village. There, along with three kids, Tamanegi, Ninjin, and Piimä, he was the captain of the band of "Usopp Pirates". He was good friends with a girl named Kaya, to whom he told grand stories about his adventures (of course, all lies). After struggling with Luffy and his friends against Black Cat Pirates, Usopp joined the Straw Hat Pirates and gave them their first ship from Kaya, the Going Merry.

  Usopp is portrayed to be very close to Luffy and Tony Tony Chopper, and frequently takes care of the Merry. After traveling a while along with the Straw Hat Pirates, during the events at Water 7 Usopp had an argument with Luffy over the status of their ship the Going Merry and left the crew.Seeing Sanji and Franky try to save Robin made Usopp feel guilty for leaving the crew, so he covered his face with a mask and cape and developed an alter-ego, "King of Snipers Sogeking" (狙撃の王様, Sogeki no Ō-sama, renamed "Sniper King" in the Viz Media manga translation).

  Usopp's declaration of war on the World Government flag is cited by fans and critics alike as one of the best moments of One Piece.Usopp gets his own bounty of 30,000,000 (under his Sogeking alter ego). After the events at Enies Lobby, he returned to the crew.

  When the crew got separated, Usopp landed on the Greenstone island, where he improved his skills for two years until he was reunited with the crew. On the island of Dressrosa he would liberate a ground of enslaved toys, earning himself a temporary bounty of 500,000,000 by Doflamingo. This later becomes a permanent bounty of 200,000,000 and the new epithet "God" Usopp (ゴッド ウソップ, Goddo Usoppu).</p>

  <h1> Marine </h1>
  <p> The Marines are the seaborne military forces of the World Government, tasked with maritime law enforcement and naval warfare operations. They maintain a presence on all of the world's known seas, through countless branch offices; however, the vast majority of their forces are focused on the Grand Line, in which resides their base of operations, Marine Headquarters. Collectively, they stand as one of the Three Great Powers, alongside the Four Emperors and the Seven Warlords of the Sea, who were later replaced by the SSG.

  Due to their actions and role, they are one of the major antagonist groups of the series overall, specifically they serve as the main antagonists in the Romance Dawn, Loguetown, Enies Lobby, Sabaody Archipelago, Marineford, Return to Sabaody and Egghead Arcs. They are also antagonists in various non-canon material, such as the Warship Island, Goat Island, G-8 and Marine Rookie filler Arcs, the fifth and eleventh movies, and the third, sixth and tenth specials.</p>
  <h2> Admiral</h2>
  <p>Admiral is the second highest rank in the hierarchy of the Marines, senior to a vice admiral and junior to the fleet admiral. There are only three admirals serving at a given time, and in light of their status as the strongest Marine officers, they count among the most powerful people in the World Government's service.</p>
  <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/564x/c7/c1/11/c7c111be40670bf82aa1b49203126039.jpg">
    <h2> Warlords</h2>
  <p> The Seven Warlords were a significant and crucial part of the government's strength. In the days before the Summit War of Marineford, the then Fleet Admiral Sengoku gravely dreaded the idea of entering into battle against Whitebeard with only one less Warlord after Jinbe was imprisoned.

  The government made it a point to only select exceptionally strong pirates to be offered the Warlord position. Some of the Warlords had bounties of well over Beli100,000,000. However, there was an enormous range in the bounties between the members due to differences in circumstances under which they were recruited, with Weevil, who had a bounty of Beli480,000,000,[5] and Blackbeard, who had no bounty at all at the time.

  It should be noted that these are their former bounties, and do not represent the current threat they could achieve as active pirates. Jinbe's bounty, for example, jumped from Beli250,000,000 to Beli438,000,000 after his resignation.Another example is Crocodile, who, with a bounty of Beli81,000,000, was imprisoned in Level 6 of Impel Down, while Luffy with a bounty of Beli300,000,000 at the time was only imprisoned on Level 5. After the Seven Warlord system was abolished, some of them gained bounties over Beli1,000,000,000, further highlighting how much stronger and more dangerous they currently are compared to when they first joined.

  Some of the Warlords possessed extremely powerful Devil Fruit powers. Some had powers that were borderline impossible to win against without proper knowledge of them, such as Hancock's ability to turn people to stone if they feel attracted to her or Doflamingo's ability to control people with invisible strings. Others had powers that could cause massive levels of destruction, even to the point of destroying an entire country, such as Kuma's power to create a powerful air bomb, or Doflamingo's power to create a massive constricting cage of strings that slash through anything in their path.

  Other Warlords were exceptionally powerful combatants, even without Devil Fruits. Mihawk is known as the world's greatest swordsman and wields one of the 12 Supreme swords, Yoru. Jinbe is the world's foremost master of the fish-man fighting style.

  While he was still a Warlord, Jinbe's allegiance to the World Government served as a symbol of inter-tribal peace.</p>

  <h2> Gorosei</h2>
  <p>The Five Elders are a council of the five highest-ranking Celestial Dragons and the Highest Authorities of the World Government (世界政府最高権力, Sekai Seifu Saikō Kenryoku?). They essentially hold the greatest authority over the world at large as far as public knowledge is concerned, although they secretly subordinate to the government's shadow leader Imu, who occupies the Empty Throne.

  The Five Elders' political sway over the World Government, its subsidiary organizations, agencies, and military branches is paramount and near illimitable, including holding absolute command over Cipher Pol, the Marines, and (prior to their disbandment) the Seven Warlords of the Sea, thus controlling two of the Three Great Powers. As of now, it is unknown how the Elders acquired their positions and how long they have been in power, but they are almost always found residing in the Room of Authority in Pangaea Castle.

  Due to their status, indirect, direct, and longstanding actions, and profound plot involvement, the Five Elders are the overarching antagonists of the One Piece series, especially its Final Saga. They first appear during the Jaya Arc and are officially named during the Egghead Arc.</p>
